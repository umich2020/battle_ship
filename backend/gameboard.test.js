create either a gameboard or long list ofr node like list, it was called an adjancency list
    i think we shoukld do board a matrix 
    empty = nuill, aka a board of 0, with length of 100(or side * side)
    -c=computer. p=player. x=hit. NO 1=boat, because each player has a board
how do we test ships being placed at specific coordinates.
    -also will need to do error handling which we get end_location
place attack function
